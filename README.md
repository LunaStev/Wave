## Overview

**Wave** is a next-generation programming language designed for developing operating systems, system software, and applications—entirely using **Wave**.  
We're building a **Wave** compiler with full hardware access.

---

## Examples

### Fibonacci sequence

```wave
fun fibonacci(n: i32) -> i32 {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    if (n == 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    
    var prev :i32 = 0;
    var curr :i32 = 1;
    var next :i32;
    var i :i32 = 2;
    
    while (i <= n) {
        next = prev + curr;
        prev = curr;
        curr = next;
        i = i + 1;
    }
    
    return curr;
}

fun main() {
    var i :i32 = 0;
    var result :i32;
    
    while (i <= 10) {
        result = fibonacci(i);
        println("fibonacci({}) = {}", i, result);
        i = i + 1;
    }

    println("END FIBONACCI");
}
```

### Pointer Swap Example

```wave
fun main() {
    var a: i32 = 10;
    var b: i32 = 20;
    
    var p1: ptr<i32> = &a;
    var p2: ptr<i32> = &b;
    
    println("Before:");
    println("a = {}, b = {}", a, b);
    println("p1 = {}, p2 = {}", deref p1, deref p2);
    
    var temp: i32 = deref p1;
    deref p1 = deref p2;
    deref p2 = temp;
    
    println("After:");
    println("a = {}, b = {}", a, b);
    println("p1 = {}, p2 = {}", deref p1, deref p2);
}
```

More examples are available inside `test/`.

## Sponsor Us

Wave is an open-source programming language built with love, care, and a long-term vision.
It’s a project that aims to push the boundaries of what low-level languages can be — without sacrificing clarity or safety.

If you believe in that vision, even a small gesture of support can make a big difference.
Wave is developed by an independent creator with no corporate backing, and your sponsorship helps keep it alive and evolving.

> 💡 Why only Ko-fi?
>
> We truly wish we could offer GitHub Sponsors or Open Collective.  
> But both platforms require Stripe for payouts — and sadly, Stripe still doesn't support South Korea.  
> PayPal is no longer an option on either platform.
>
> So for now, Ko-fi is the only channel available for sponsorship.  
> It may not be ideal, but every bit of support means more than words can say.
